  abstract     = {HADES is a large acceptance spectrometer operating at SIS18, GSI, in Darmstadt, Germany [1]. It is aimed at exploration of the QCD phase diagram at the ion beam energies of 1-2 AGeV in the region of high density baryonic matter. An unphysical behavior of particle directed flow deduced from raw experimental data obtained during experimental study of Au+Au collisions at 1.23 AGeV is observed. It is found that dependence of the directed flow on rapidity does not show the antisymmetry expected in the symmetric projectile-target system, and there is significant non-zero directed flow at midrapidity where this component has to be zero, again from the system symmetry reasons. Possible explanation of the effect is due to the final granularity of corresponding detector and hence limited resolution of close particle tracks.}

  abstract   = {Asymptotic solutions of the nonlocal, one-dimensional Fisher–Kolmogorov–Petrovskii–Piskunov equation with
                fractional derivatives in the diffusion operator are constructed. The fractional derivative is defined in
                accordance with the approaches of Weyl, Grünwald–Letnilkov, and Liouville. Asymptotic solutions are
                constructed in a class of functions that are a perturbation of the found exact quasistationary solution and tend
                at large times to this quasistationary solution. It is shown that the presence of fractional derivatives leads to
                drift of the center of mass of the initial distribution and breaks its symmetry}
